1. Run server.py in your server which has a public connection (Example: melii.club or 123.45.67.89)

2. Now visit <your server domain>/addThis@<the domain you want> (Example: melii.club/addThis@myLocalhost) which will give you a random number

3. Replace the port number in your client.py with that random number and start your client.py and you are good to go.

4. Now your localhost(only port 80) can be accecssed globally via <your server domain>/<domain you wanted> (Example: melii.club/myLocalHost)
